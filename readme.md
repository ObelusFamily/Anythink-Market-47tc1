# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

## How to setup the environment and start using docker:
- install the docker 
- If it is properly installed , go to cmd run the following command docker -v and docker-compose-v for the confirmation
- After that run the command docker-compose up from the project root directory(that is go to the folder where you have clone your Anythink repo from the cmd itslef and run the comand)
- if you are getting some error(Make sure you installed the updated version and keep your Linux file update too).
- if you have done this far bingo!!!!
- point your browser to local host
- and your environment is ready
